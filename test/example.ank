# The Syntax
# ----------
#
# Lines starting with a "#", optionally with leading tabs (but not spaces), are ignored by the parser.
#
# When not in a token (for example, in a string), "# " in a line makes the rest of the line, including the "# ", ignored
# by the parser. Notice the space following the "#", which is essential, because we specify RRGGBB colors with "#RRGGBB"
# format.
#
# The hierarchy is indicated by tab-indentations (space-indentations are syntax errors).
#
# Extended types and properties have (Java-like) reverse domain name style prefixes. They must be aliased to
# simple-names before used in the main text. These lines must be at the top of the file before defining any entity, view,
# or transition.
